# TODO
---

- [x] Set up `cjs` & `esm` output
- [x] Finish examples
- [x] Publish to npm
  - [x] unit tests
- [x] Add delay to loader to prevent flash
- [x] Add "bundles loading" message to the app for slow connections
- [ ] Possibly switch from `glamor` to `stylus` for just the module. Keeping
  the breakpoints consistent in the example may end up being too hacky.
